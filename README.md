## Create a web application using Flask:  

#### First page "/question-with-one-answer" has a form with a submit button and two inputs inside:
* Textarea with label "Give me a question" (mandatory field)
* Dropdown with label "Set the only answer". Possible selection: Yes, No (default yes)
* Form must be submitted with GET method to "/the-question" URL
#### When the form is filled and submitted

* Take the GET parameters and generate a page where the question is written out in a heading tag
* Below the heading there are the answers on two buttons (Yes, No). If the button is pressed which the user selected on the form previously then a popup should come up with message "I knew you selected this :)" otherwise when the user tries to press the other button then the button should jump away from the mouse cursor.
* You may ask: "What is the nice way to pass data from HTML (if it is Python generated then from Python) to a javascript file". The answer is: data attributes: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes
